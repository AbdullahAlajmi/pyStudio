# Introduction

This document is intended for all developers, contributors, and members of the Elm's PyStudio community who want to follow a common code of ethics in which to work together.
This document does not refer to the form of contribution to the project, but to the relations between the members of the community. Transparency, appreciation of all participants, sincerity and commitment will be a common goal.
Ethics in our community and project is a long-term commitment that spans the duration of the project, it is a sincere commitment of our organization to be present in the project on an ongoing basis.
Our organization has decided to make a commitment to the project and support it in the community, the initial commitment includes support to all members of the community during the first two years of project release, with the possibility of extending these two years if the project reaches the goals that have been established in the project sheet (document available).

##Community and developers

We will dedicate at least 1% of our organization's time to the project. it means that at least a couple of developers are going to be full time working in the project.
We will respond to all queries from the community in a reasonable amount of time, provided that they have not already been answered, and we commit to include in the project documentation every 6 months a sheet with the most recurrent queries and answers.
All community members will have early access to all software developed and subsequent releases once they have been verified in production. As we have not set up a CI/CD yet our revisions are going to be "manually" done by our team.

##End users

End users will be served in the first instance by active members of the community, committing ourselves to monitor the answers given, and to escalate to the lead developers in case there are problems that cannot be solved by the community.
End users will be supported in the installation of the software.
Proposals from end users will be listened to and raised to the community in case new developments are needed, if the committee of our organization deems it appropriate, the developments will be undertaken by our team.


##Organization and operation of the community

Meetings or conferences with community members, developers and collaborators will be organized. They will be called at least 72 working hours in advance.
The content of the meetings or conferences will be sent with the call and all members of the community will be aware of all the topics.
Conferences or meetings will generally be limited to 2 hours.
Free software will be used for the same.


##General commintments of our organization.

- Support the project throughout its life cycle.
- Supporting the community, generating events for member interaction and rewarding the most active and collaborating members.
